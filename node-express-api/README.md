# Running the backend
- npm install in backend folder
- `npm run start:dev` or just `npm run start`

# Need improvements
- handle throttling (not important right now since test app)
- add more tests (going to add if time permits)
- authentication (time limit constraints for PoC)
- add linter and more strict type checking(doing it in frontend)
- no localization support for now

# Assumption
- location not sure what to include, added town and country for now
