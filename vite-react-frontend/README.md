# Running front-end application

- npm install
- npm run dev

# TODO

- extract reducer
- set up tests
- accesibility

# Excluded
- client side caching
- theming

# Design decisions
- css grid over semantic table for flexibility with design and responsiveness
- column width based on possible data length increase/change

# Assumptions

- Data size will scale and secure data handling with more consistency, so filtering on backend seems better than getting all data
